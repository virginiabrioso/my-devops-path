# What If I don't want to leave Windows and start to use Linux? Meet WSL!

There a a few options available for this question such as _dual-boot, VM, WSL_ etc. In my point of view dual boot let you full experience Linux, you can use graphic distribution and start to work using command lines. But, yes, it is very boring to do configurations and restart your computer when you want use Linux. VM it is not a good option if you don't have a nice setup, because it request a lot from your environment. WSL is used a lot in software development, it deliver great performance in experiment Linux without left Windows. Yeah, it deserve a section only for this.

According to Microsoft, "Windows Subsystem for Linux run a GNU/Linux environment (including most command-line tools, utilities, and applications) directly on Windows, unmodified".

The first launch, WSL 1, used a translation layer between Linux Distro and Windows Kernel. Now WSL, what we call WSL 2, included a full Linux kernel.
