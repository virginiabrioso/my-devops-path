# ðŸ¥³ Welcome!

## Welcome aboard!

Since entering the world of technology, everything I've learned, experienced and studied is all in my head. No notes. Just me, keyboard and Google. So one day I thought, what if I just fill up my mental disk and there's no space for more knowledge? So I decided to start small posts about things that, in my experience and research, are important. Like some definitions, mini-tutorials, new platforms and tools I'm studying/testing, stuff like that. I'm going to call this 'My DevOps Path' because I want to document everything I have related to DevOps.
